## kjkent's PID Tuning Test Branch

[![Klipper](docs/img/klipper-logo-small.png)](https://www.klipper3d.org/)

This branch takes the latest (at time of writing) code from the [Klipper](https://github.com/klipper3d/klipper) `master` branch, and merges in @dans98's work on PID tuning.

This codebase is experimental and should not be blindly used by others. Aside from merging a few cherry-picked commits, all credit goes to the aforementioned authors.
